This is just a small personal project I did to experiment with using APIs and I'm really happy with how it turned out.
It is missing some input validation and certain checks, pytube recently had an update that broke how it worked with
YouTube's api so it now uses pytubefix.
It monitors a playlist I have on my spotify account and downloads the mp3 files, if you want to try this functionality
 just remove some songs from the files and run the program.
